# Wavelet-Decomposition-of-Audio-Signals
Wavelet Decomposition is a wavelet transform where the
Discrete-time signal is passed through more filters than the
discrete wavelet transform.In this project we used an audio
Signal for decomposition.
Application - We can apply the wavelet decomposition method in audio signal procesing and imgae processing. 
In this Project, we were able to decompose the audio signal into different levels by employing Wavelet Decomposition.
